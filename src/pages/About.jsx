  My career started as a print designer agency side 10 years ago and I gradually moved more onto the digital side of things and I have been working in UX and corporate CX in the last five years.
  
  And now I find myself enjoying lots of coding!

  {/* Since the end of 2023, I've been doing a lot of research (mainly on React and its adjacent JS ecosystem), learning and just generally doing web development stuff in my free time. This site also gives me an excuse to play around with new trends and share my experiences.
  
  The ability to start with product ideas and deploy live solutions have always fascinated me, so that's why I find myself enjoying both design and development. */}
