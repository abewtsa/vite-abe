      I've been working in UI/UX for the past 5 years and currently having a lot of fun delving into front end stuffs. The projects and designs revolve around Figma, React and NextJS. This site can be a bit messy (and will be updated a lot), do please check things out. It will be migrated â€“ or rebuilt from scratch â€“ to Astro or NextJS at some point.

      Curious on my thoughts on UX/UI and Front End? Check out the About blog section.

      Figma links and projects are listed below, and you can reach out to me by email."
