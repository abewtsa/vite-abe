      For the past 5 years, my UI/UX work has been largely in enterprise CX, with hands-on involvement in content update, management and UX design for one of the largest Australian non for profit.

      My projects and designs that you can explore in this site revolve around Figma prototypes, React and NextJS. While this site is still a work in progress, I'm hopeful that you will find useful information.

      Figma links and projects are listed below, and you can reach out to me by email."
