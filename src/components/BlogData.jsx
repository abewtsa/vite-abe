        <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p>
          HOOPS is a user review, event and venue management app for small and
          medium business. It is being built on the React/NextJS stack as a web
          application, with a set of modern web technologies. Users can scan QR
          codes, book their reservations and review their experience in one go
          with HOOPS.
        </p>
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>
          While ubiquitous QR codes have seen widespread use, the main
          bottleneck of serving a great user experience still lies on the
          landing page that the user will visit after scanning a QR code.
          Another gap often seen is once QR codes have served their purpose of
          allowing users to access links from their camera equipped smart
          devices, they are often disregarded and taken out of the user journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          HOOPS intends to bind QR codes and their link properties to be more
          intrinsic to the user journey to empower businesses. Though this is
          not a technical novelty, smarter use of QR codes, generated on demand
          can enrich the user experience for the customers.
        </p>
        <h2>Design system</h2>
        <p>
          As an early idea HOOPS is a simple event management website. But as
          the product design is refined and conceptualised further, there will
          be a need for an engaging user dashboard, or user centre. A seamless
          design and journey through different pages demands a basic design
          system to guide the component design with a coherent design language.
          HOOPS will be equiped with a component library and continously be
          updated as the product grows.
        </p>

        <h2>Work in progress</h2>
        <p>
          HOOPS is a product that will continue to grow, starting as a platform
          to launch and use the latest web technologies like NextJS, React and
          Typescript with a modern scalable backend (Postgres with Prisma and
          Supabase). With a design system to guide the design languange and
          components design, together with iterative product design process
          HOOPS hopefully will emerge into a useful valuable product that users
          can enjoy and rely on.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          End to end product design is a different task from producing some
          elements of page UI or delivering UX artefacts. Working on a complete
          product design requires swapping hats and views between developing the
          right product features, thinking about user journey and the right
          solution and fidelity for your UI. YesFresh, as mobile app product,
          encapsulates the end to end design process for such complete design
          work.
        </p>

        <img src="/public/YesFresh-Splash.jpeg" alt="YesFresh screenshot" />

        <h2>The Brief</h2>
        <p>
          Apps like Menulog, Uber, Deliveroo(RIP) offers food delivery from
          their partner restaurants to our doors. While a different model like
          HelloFresh or Lite 'n Easy uses a subscription model to let users
          schedule and plan meals. YesFresh attempts to combine both models,
          offering the user to choose meals from their favourite restaurants,
          with the flexibility of scheduling and planning the meal delivery.
        </p>

        <h2>Design Process</h2>
        <p>
          Product discovery was done to identify the features that need to be
          designed that enable other Apps already in market to respond to the
          brief. The product features are: a screen to list option of restaurant
          and meals available to the user, a meal planning and scheduling
          screen, meal item selection and management screen, meal planning and
          scheduling screen, and finally, as usual, a member dashboard.
        </p>

        <h2>Figma: Auto-layout, Styles, and Variables</h2>
        <p>
          As an early adopter of Figma, the core feature of Figma for me has
          always been a light weight browser based design tool, versatile and
          powerful at the same time. For users of Adobe CC Suite tools like
          Photoshop or Illustrator, or designers growing up from print design
          background, Auto layout could feel restrictive sometimes (or at least
          that's how I felt initially about it). You can get away with the
          freedom of assigning layout manually or just let it go, trust the
          process and let Auto layout take over. I have loved how Auto-layout
          works, and admitedly uses it more often that not now, when maybe I
          shouldn't. Styles is a common feature found in design tools, as in
          Figma, a powerful tool that lets you quickly prototype, build up your
          design library or deliver your final design. Variables take this to
          the next leve with more granularity and control, and lets you use them
          as design tokens in your design system. Going back to YesFresh, the
          requirement to deliver a complete design means using all these Figma
          features as a disciplined designer with in-depth understanding, for
          example, setting up Auto-layouts correctly lets me edit one main
          component and transfer the changes properly to all component
          instances.

        <h2>Design decisions</h2>
        <p>
          Mobile app legibility is the main factor affecting the design
          decisions. With lots of interaction and transfers between screens,
          users need to have responsive input icons with enough room to breath
          in the small mobile space. Accessibility and distinct colour palette
          are also required to make the app look and feel distinct from the
          competitors in the space.
        </p>

        </p>

        <h2>Building a component library</h2>
        <p>
          I love a good component library, even with a collection of some basic
          buttons or elements. The popularity of various UI libraries and ready
          to use/consume UI primitives library like Radix allows speedy
          development of component libraries at any scale. For a coherent and
          iterable design delivery, it is imperative that any design process
          include considerations for a reusable component library. Setup your
          components early and it will pay off in the long run.
        </p>

        <h2>AI Generated Figma Components?</h2>
        <p>
          In the early part of the design process I have tested several Figma
          plugins to generate components building block and the results were far
          from interesting or useful. Figma has recently acquired Diagram, an
          AI-UI startup and while AI tool are helpful in some use cases (nice
          Lorem Ipsums, or quickly generating ideas and iterating through them),
          this project has yet to find the full potential of AI in UI, at the
          same time I'm positively looking forward to see and use AI tools in
          Figma projects.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          I was working on parts of this project during my holiday in Japan in
          and throughout 2023. This project has brought together the different
          parts of using Figma in my professional experience to an end-to-end
          delivery of a design project. Further from current state I wish to see
          design backlog and refinement of each screens or some of the design
          features, to mature the design further.

          Welcome to my site and the blog area, where I share my thoughts on all
          things UX/UI/Front-end. It's been recently rewritten in May 2024, and
          I try to keep this blog written in vanilla React and Vite with no
          other library, as my other go to stack is NextJS. The design is
          shamelessly stolen from Helena Zhang and Tobias Fried from the{" "}

        <h2>Why I love Zed</h2>

          <strong>May 2024</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          As a new developer, when I look outside of VSCode, there is an amazing
          collection of IDEs out there. The temptation is to explore and pick up
          something other than VSCode, and get into a deep rabbit hole (VIM for
          example). Zed gives me a simple yet powerful IDE, especially when I
          work on solo projects with a mono repo. I never felt that I misses
          anything else from VSCode when using Zed and it also has Copilot
          integration.{" "}
